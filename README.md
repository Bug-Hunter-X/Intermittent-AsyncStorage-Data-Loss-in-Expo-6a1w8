# Intermittent AsyncStorage Data Loss in Expo

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with AsyncStorage in an Expo managed workflow.  The issue is characterized by inconsistent data persistence across app restarts.  Sometimes data is saved correctly, other times it is lost without obvious error messages. 

## Bug Description
The AsyncStorage API in Expo appears to have intermittent failures in saving data persistently across app restarts.  The application state is affected, resulting in data loss and an unpredictable user experience.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe how the AsyncStorage methods behave. Data may persist correctly on some restarts, while being lost in others.

## Solution
The provided solution explores potential fixes, including checking for storage availability and implementing additional error handling. The implementation in bugSolution.js addresses this problem by ensuring storage is available before attempting storage operations and introduces better error handling and logging to diagnose the issue.  More robust solutions may involve exploring alternative storage options or more complex error handling and retry mechanisms.
